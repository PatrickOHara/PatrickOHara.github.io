	<h1>Hi, I'm Patrick</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a research assistant at University of Warwick and a visiting researcher at the Alan Turing Institute.

	<p>
		My research focuses on graph and optimisation algorithms for NP-hard problems with applications to air pollution.

		I am part of the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/clean-air-london">Clean Air in London</a> project which aims to develop machine learning algorithms to understand and predict air quality in London. The algorithms I develop take these pollution models and find trajectories which minimise the pollution of exposure of a person following the trajectory.
