        Patrick is a research assistant at the University of Warwick supervised by 
        <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/theo_damoulas/">Dr Theo Damoulas</a> and 
        <a href="https://msramanujan.weebly.com">Dr Ramanujan Sridharan</a>.
        He is a visiting researcher at the Alan Turing Institute and is a member of the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/london-air-quality">London air quality</a> project at the Turing. 
        During his BSc in Computer Science at Warwick, he was awarded a first class for his thesis titled 'Running from Air Pollution', which ultimately led to his current role as research assistant.

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Research</h4>
    <p>
        Patrick's research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning.
        Specific areas include graph theory, integer programming, reinforcement learning and optimisation.
        He is always looking for applications for his research, particularly in urban environments.

    <p>
        This project aims to reduce the amount of air pollution people living in London are exposed to when moving about the city. Specifically, Patrick is researching algorithms to find running routes which minimise the air pollution of a runner starting and ending at the same point. This problem is NP-hard, which means finding the optimal solution is infeasible for large inputs. Therefore, research concentrates on heuristic methods. These heuristics are then analysed against lower bounds to evaluate their performance.
